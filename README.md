# Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹
### The person behind the name
Hi! I'm Max, a Computer Science student from Poland, currently studying at the AGH University of KrakÃ³w. My IT-related interests include the general area of ML and AI, particularly problems regarding CV and NLP.

### Technologies I use
I create my models in Python, most often using Keras+TF, PyTorch, ScikitLearn, Pandas; I'm familiar with creating NNs from scratch using only Numpy, as well as image processing with OpenCV+Mediapipe. <br />

Apart from Python, I'm familiar with C and C++, as well as some front-end technologies and frameworks including Java(Type)Script, React and Tailwind. I've also deployed a [website](https://brave-mushroom-033507c03.4.azurestaticapps.net/) using Azure Static Web Apps and Jekyll themes.

### Projects
I'm currently working on a real-time PJM (Polish Sign Language)-to-Polish translation model; so far it's been taught to recognize letters from the Polish alphabet. I'm also in the process of implementing YOLOv5 from scratch using Torch. My completed projects include a simple NN trained on MNIST, as well as an implementation of LeNet-5 trained on MNIST-Fashion.  

### Goals
My short-term goals include learning Docker and Kubernetes. I'm also looking forward to taking part in some Kaggle contests to get familiar with the concept of exploratory data analysis when constructing ML models.

### Collab with me!
I'm open to collaborative work, so if you'd like to have me on board simply let me know via Discord (worthy_11) or e-mail (slotamax15@gmail.com).
