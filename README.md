# Welcome 👋
I'm Max, an undergrad CS & AI student @ AGH University of Krakow. I specialize in Data Analysis, ML Models and Agentic AI; also familiar with DevOps! <br />

# Projects
## Ongoing
### 🟩Real-time Polish Sign Language Translator
As a Project Lead @ AI Lab AGH Student Research Group, I'm developing a real-time translation system for Polish Sign Language gloss sequence recognition and translation into written Polish, reducing raw RGB data to pose landmarks using Google's MediaPipe module. Together with a team of dedicated researchers, we have developed the first PSL recognition dataset. <br />
- **Presented at**: Krakow Tech Summit 2024 @ Krakow, AINOW 2025 @ Nice <br />
- **Technologies**: PyTorch, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Microsoft Azure <br />

### 🟩Glioblastoma In Vivo Growth Simulation 
Inspired by several articles on the topic of agentic multi-scale tumor growth models, I developed a simulation environment which considers nutrient concentration, gas diffusion across blood vessel walls, intra-vascular pressure and many more factors. Validated on data obtained from experiments on mice. Created as a team effort together with 2 students @ AGH. <br />
- **Developed for**: Discrete Systems Simulations course @ AGH <br />
- **Technologies**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib <br />

### 🟩MiniORM - A Custom Object-Relational Mapping Library
I'm working on a custom ORM Python module which enables manipulation of persistent storage without writing a line of SQL. Classes' attributes, domain-specific behaviour, inheritance, and other relationships will translate into a structured database automatically. Developed together with 2 other students @ AGH. <br />
- **Developed for**: Design Patterns course @ AGH <br />
- **Technologies**: FastAPI, React.js, sqlite3 <br />
- [**Repository link**](To Be Created)

### 🟩Make-up Invariant Face Verification System 
I'm a part of a team of 2, implementing a system capable of face verification despite makeup application. We explore different approaches to the issue, including transfer learning and finetuning or employing triplet loss in model training from scratch. CSD-MT model is used for data augmentation, while the VGGFace model is compared against our own solution inspired by FaceNet. <br />
- **Developed for**: Project Studio course @ AGH <br />
- **Technologies**: Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib <br />

## Completed

### 🟦Satellite-based Vehicle Mobility Estimation System
3rd place @ Cassini 2024 across Poland. I implemented a rule-based, fuzzy-logic expert system which uses satellite data and vehicle characteristics to provide reliable paths for emergency and military vehicles in difficult terrain. Developed within 48 hours :) <br />
- **Presented at**: Cassini 2024 <br />
- **Technologies**: scikit-fuzzy, Sentinel API, SoilGrids, Open Street Map API <br />

### 🟦Video Analysis Tool for Speech Quality Assessment
I deployed a solution which integrates video, sound, and transcript analysis to provide a concise review of the overall presentation quality, as well as a list of possible improvements. Developed within 24 hours together with AI Lab AGH. <br />
- **Developed for**: HackYeah 2024 <br />
- **Technologies**: Django, React.js, OpenAI API, Azure Speech Service, OpenCV <br />
- [**Repository link**](https://github.com/worthy11/hackyeah2024)

### 🟦Sales Estimator with Environmental, Cultural, and Political Event Context
Leveraging decision tree models for sequence modeling, I created a sales level estimation system that considers events such as natural disasters, popular artists' shows, and tariff introductions in order to produce its predictions. I took on deploying and developing a UI for the solution implemented as a team effort together with AI Lab AGH. Developed within 24 hours :) <br />
- **Developed for**: Hackology 2024 <br />
- **Technologies**: Pandas, scikit-learn, OpenAI API, Django, React.js <br />

### 🟦Roamly.ai
Intended for improving travelling and sightseeing experience, Roamly came into existence as our idea for the HackYeah 2025 hackathon. Integrating a handful of useful travel-related APIs together with an agentic approach supported by vector search resulted in a clean web app, where you can record your journeys, get inspired by others' experiences, and ask your AI assistant for direct suggestions. Developed within 24 hours :) <br />
- **Developed for**: HackYeah 2025 <br />
- **Technologies**: OpenAI API, Tavily API, Amadeus API <br />

### ConnectIT
A new programming language I created together with 2 other AGH students, meant for modeling 3D origami structures. Supports various domain-specific as well as standard data types, conditional statements and loops, function declaration and definition, adn object creation. Presented as a web app with an integrated code editor! <br />
- **Developed for**: Compilation Theory and Compilers course @ AGH <br />
- **Technologies**: antlr4, Plotly, FastAPI, React.js <br />
