# Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹
### The person behind the name
Hi! I'm Max, a Computer Science student from Poland, currently studying at the AGH University of KrakÃ³w. My IT-related interests include the general area of ML and AI, particularly problems regarding CV and NLP.

### Technologies I use
I create my models in Python, most often using Keras+TF, PyTorch, ScikitLearn, Pandas; I'm familiar with creating NNs from scratch using only Numpy, as well as image processing with OpenCV+Mediapipe. <br />

Apart from Python, I'm familiar with C, C++ and Java, as well as some front-end technologies and frameworks including JS, TS, React and Tailwind. I've also deployed a [website](https://brave-mushroom-033507c03.4.azurestaticapps.net/) using Azure Static Web Apps and Jekyll themes.

### Projects
I'm currently working on a real-time PJM (Polish Sign Language)-to-Polish translation model. I'm also in the process of implementing YOLOv5 from scratch using Torch. My completed projects include:
- a desktop app desigend for learning the Polish Sign Alphabet (OpenCV, TensorFlow, MediaPipe)
- a sales forecasting web app with event context [Hackology hackathon, 2024] (XGBoost, PyTorch, Django, React.js) 
- a video analysis web tool for assessing the quality of speech [HackYeah hackathon, 2024] (OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyTorch, Django, React.js, Azure Speech Service) 
- a simple NN implemented from scratch and trained on MNIST (Numpy)
- an implementation of LeNet-5 trained on MNIST-Fashion

### Goals
My short-term goals include learning Docker and Kubernetes.

### Collab with me!
I'm open to collaborative work, so if you'd like to have me on board simply let me know via Discord (worthy_11) or e-mail (slotamax15@gmail.com).
