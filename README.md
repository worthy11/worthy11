# Projects
## Ongoing
### 🟩Real-time Polish Sign Language Translator
Real-time translation system for Polish Sign Language gloss sequence recognition and translation into written Polish, reducing raw RGB data to pose landmarks using Google's MediaPipe module. Together with a team of dedicated researchers, we have developed the first PSL recognition dataset. A letter-learning application is available as a demo. <br />
- **Presented at**: Krakow Tech Summit 2024 @ Krakow, AINOW 2025 @ Nice <br />
- **Technologies**: PyTorch, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Microsoft Azure <br />
- **Demo Technologies**: C++, QT, OpenCV, MediaPipe <br />

- [**Demo**](https://github.com/worthy11/PP2Project) 

### 🟩Glioblastoma In Vivo Growth Simulation 
A simulation environment modeling nutrient concentration, gas diffusion, and intra-vascular pressure, refined through repeated experiments and statistical analysis. Validated on real-world data, the solution provides real-time visualization of the developing cells and their environment. <br />
- **Developed for**: Discrete Systems Simulations course @ AGH <br />
- **Technologies**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib <br />

### 🟩MiniORM - A Custom Object-Relational Mapping Library
Custom ORM Python module enabling manipulation of persistent storage with no SQL involved. Automate translating attributes, domain-specific behaviour, inheritance, and relations into a structured database. <br />
- **Developed for**: Design Patterns course @ AGH <br />
- **Technologies**: FastAPI, React.js, sqlite3 <br />
- [**Repository link**](To Be Created)

### 🟩AquaTest - Aquarium Parameter Monitoring with Automatic Feeding  
Using an ESP32 chip combined with temperature, pH, and break-beam sensors, the system allows for remote water parameter monitoring and scheduled feeding. The product comes with an OLED display, a dedicated mobile app, BLE provisioning, and WiFi connectivity for real-time control from anywhere in the world. <br />
- **Developed for**: Internet of Things course @ AGH <br />
- **Technologies**: C, ESP-IDF, NimBLE, ESP32, I2C, 1-Wire <br />
- [**Repository link**](https://github.com/worthy11/iot)

### 🟩Make-up Invariant Face Verification System 
Leveraging transfer learning, finetuning, and data augmentation, the  system tackles verification in spite of extensive make-up application. Using CSD-MT for style transfer, Google’s MediaPipe for detection, and VGGFace as a foundation model, the pipeline provides efficient and precise results. <br />
- **Developed for**: Project Studio course @ AGH <br />
- **Technologies**: Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib <br />
